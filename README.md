# AHK

I use a Corsair iCue Keyboard.

I have the autohotkey CTRL+J mapped with a G-Key (macro key).

If you want to stop interupt in the middle there is no built in method in AHK to do this. The quick google searches I have found do not work in 2021. 

I made a PS2EXE script to map to a G-Key and it kills all AHK processes and reloads my clipboard script.
